# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis in natural language processing (NLP) involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text. It’s commonly used to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a fascinating task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. Let’s create a brief description for your project using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and an example dataset from Kaggle.

Project Title: Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis

Description: The “Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis” project applies NLTK and machine learning techniques to classify Amazon product reviews into three categories: ‘Positive,’ ‘Neutral,’ and ‘Negative.’ Here are the key steps involved:

  Data Collection:
      Obtain a dataset of Amazon product reviews. One such dataset is available on Kaggle, containing millions of Amazon reviews in fastText format1.
      Alternatively, you can use the Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset (version 2.0) with 25 product reviews on Amazon products2.
  Data Preprocessing:
      Clean the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
      Convert text to lowercase for consistency.
  Feature Extraction:
      Extract relevant features from the text, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF vectors, or word embeddings.
      These features serve as input for the sentiment analysis model.
  Sentiment Analysis:
      Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning) using the labeled dataset.
      Use NLTK’s tools for text classification and sentiment analysis.
      Predict the sentiment label (positive, neutral, or negative) for each review.
  Data Visualization:
      Visualize the distribution of sentiments using plots (e.g., bar charts or pie charts).
      Explore patterns and trends in the data.
  Predictive Modeling:
      Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
      Fine-tune the model if necessary.
